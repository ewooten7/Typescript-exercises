Intro:

    We have so many users and admins in the database!
    CEO's father Jeff says that we are a BigData
    startup now. We have no idea what it means, but
    Jeff says that we need to do some statistics and
    analytics.

    We've ran a questionnaire within the team to
    figure out what do we know about statistics.
    The only person who filled it was our coffee
    machine maintainer. The answers were:

     * Maximums
     * Minumums
     * Medians
     * Averages

    We found a piece of code on stackoverflow and
    compiled it into a module `stats`. The bad
    thing is that it lacks type declarations.

Exercise:

    Check stats module implementation at:
    node_modules/stats/index.js
    node_modules/stats/README.md

    Provide type declaration for that module in:
    declarations/stats/index.d.ts

Higher difficulty bonus exercise:

    Avoid duplicates of type declarations.
